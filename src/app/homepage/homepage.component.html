    Welcome to BSA Troop 47! Whether you are crossing over from Webelos Scouts,
    transferring from another Boy Scout troop, or entering Scouting for the
    first time, the experience you are about to embark upon has the potential to
    be one of the most memorable, rewarding experiences of your lifetime. And,
    what’s really unique about this program is that it is led by the boys
    themselves! Troop 47 has a robust program with a very wide variety of
    activities available to the Scouts. The troop has a campout almost every
    month of the year. One month the troop may be rock climbing; another month
    they may be hiking; on other campouts the focus may be on basic Scout skills
    such as first aid, knot tying, cooking, or fire building. Frequently our
    program also includes, at some point in the year, activities focused on
    shooting sports, wilderness survival, and leadership development. The
    activities on the schedule each year depend on what the boys decide to
    include in their program. Fundamental to the structure of the program is the
    concept that the troop is boy-led. This does not mean that the boys are in
    charge and whatever happens just happens. Rather, consistent with the
    original intent of Baden Powell, the founder of the worldwide Scouting
    movement, it means that the boys lead the troop under the direction of an
    adult leader. When the first Scout units were established, Baden Powel
    observed: “We then made the discovery that boys, when trusted and relied on,
    were just as capable and reliable as men.” At Troop 47, we fully endorse the
    boy-led concept and are committed to supporting the boy leadership so that
    they may be successful and effective in their efforts. Parent involvement is
    an integral part of the Scouting program and key to the success of our
    troop. We cannot do this program without the support and active
    participation of all parents. We encourage the parents of our Scouts to
    become involved either on the organization and administration side through
    participation on our Troop Committee, or as Assistant Scoutmasters working
    directly with the boys in the program. We are excited that you have decided
    to join the Boy Scouts and in particular Troop 47. We look forward to
    working with you and we know you are in for the experience of a lifetime!

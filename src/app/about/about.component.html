      Welcome to BSA Troop 47! Whether you are crossing over from Webelos Scouts,
      transferring from another Boy Scout troop, or entering Scouting for the
      first time, the experience you are about to embark upon has the potential to
      be one of the most memorable, rewarding experiences of your lifetime. And,
      what’s really unique about this program is that it is led by the boys
      themselves! Troop 47 has a robust program with a very wide variety of
      activities available to the Scouts. The troop has a campout almost every
      month of the year. One month the troop may be rock climbing; another month
      they may be hiking; on other campouts the focus may be on basic Scout skills
      such as first aid, knot tying, cooking, or fire building. Frequently our
      program also includes, at some point in the year, activities focused on
      shooting sports, wilderness survival, and leadership development. The
      activities on the schedule each year depend on what the boys decide to
      include in their program. Fundamental to the structure of the program is the
      concept that the troop is boy-led. This does not mean that the boys are in
      charge and whatever happens just happens. Rather, consistent with the
      original intent of Baden Powell, the founder of the worldwide Scouting
      movement, it means that the boys lead the troop under the direction of an
      adult leader. When the first Scout units were established, Baden Powel
      observed: “We then made the discovery that boys, when trusted and relied on,
      were just as capable and reliable as men.” At Troop 47, we fully endorse the
      boy-led concept and are committed to supporting the boy leadership so that
      they may be successful and effective in their efforts. Parent involvement is
      an integral part of the Scouting program and key to the success of our
      troop. We cannot do this program without the support and active
      participation of all parents. We encourage the parents of our Scouts to
      become involved either on the organization and administration side through
      participation on our Troop Committee, or as Assistant Scoutmasters working
      directly with the boys in the program. We are excited that you have decided
      to join the Boy Scouts and in particular Troop 47. We look forward to
      working with you and we know you are in for the experience of a lifetime!
